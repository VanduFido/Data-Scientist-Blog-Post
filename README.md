# Data-Scientist-Blog-Post
### Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project 1

## Introduction
For this project, I created a blog post on medium about Stack Overflow and this accompanying Github repository to add to my Data Science portfolio.

## Project Motivation
I use Stack Overflow to debug. i am interested in the pattern of users from around the globe.

Understanding the demographics of users of stack overflow gives insight to the business on where their market lies and how best to improve and target audience.

For users, it helps understand better the community they wish to be a part of and the preference of their peers.

To understand the demographics, three questions are answered as follows:

* What Countres have the most Stack Overflow Activities?

* What is the distribution of Main Branches using Stack Overflow?

* What is the Age distribution of Stack Overflow users?
